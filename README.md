# Overnode VueJs Client

Overnode is a Bitcoin full node monitoring and explorer (query) tool which provides a GraphQL interface.  This project contains a client / UI implementation written in VueJs which is hosted at [overnode.org](https://overnode.org). For the server side code, visit the [propellerlabsio/overnode-server Github](https://github.com/propellerlabsio/overnode-server).

**WARNING:** 

**This project is heavily under construction and in a beta state.  Some functionality is missing and there may be outstanding security flaws.  Do not run this code exposed to the internet with a bitcoin node containing a live, non-test wallet**
